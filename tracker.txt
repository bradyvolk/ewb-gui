Current Tasks:
- Custom map creation/navigation
    - Side-scrolling
    - Zooming
    - Ensuring GPS-Pixel conversions remain consistent with transformations
- Update dependencies / debugging

- 11/14/2020: 
    - add button functionality to mapview for drawmode, undo and clear 
    - fix bug that makes top of mapview screen turn blue when on_touch_event occurs 
    - indicate to user where they have touched with a marker 

Completed Tasks (include completed task and date)
**11/14/2020 (Saturday) - Brady and Sunny 
    - Added line segment drawing in the mapview 
**12/01/2020 (Tuesday) - Brady and Sunny
    - Added line segment draw mode, undo, clear, recenter, and image uplaod
**12/03/2020 (Thursday) - Brady and Sunny
    - Added dialog to get corner GPS coords of images imported
**12/16/2020 (Wednesday) - Jason and Brady
    - Separated Coordinates into tuples for user input, started creating the method to compute path
**1/21/2020 (Thursday) - Brady
    - Finished compute path function, but still has some bugs that prevent it from writing to text file.
    need to figure out why the coordinates for line segments can be out of bounds of the 
    pixel_to_GPS array. The line segments pixel values must not correspond to the same as the pixel
    values on the original image, maybe there is some hidden scaling.

Technical Challenges/Roadblocks:
- (insert here as specific as possible, including issue and relevant 
    lines of code)
- Fix "Route Planning" background banner from getting darker when starting drawing, not sure why this is happening.
- Image filetype validation
- Testing Pixel_to_GPS 
- Checking Pixel_to_GPS accepts inputs of all four corners, but only requries 3.
- Indicate to user that they're in draw mode
- Creating GPS coordinates to send and printing to file from line segments drawn 
- Given a distance between coordinates, figuring out what to add between each point
- **Figure out why image coordinates of line segments are out of bounds of the original image size**
